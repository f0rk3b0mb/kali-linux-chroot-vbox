# kali-linux-chroot
If you don't want to run a full blown Kali VM and just want to have a shell with all the tools available.

## Installation
1. Install VMware Player
2. Download Kali VirtualBox  Image (https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/)
3. Adjust path for the vdi image variable in the code
4. Run "**sudo ./kali-chroot start**"
5. Happy hacking ;)


I added networking support and /dev/pts
